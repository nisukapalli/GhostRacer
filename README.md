# GhostRacer

GhostRacer is a project applying OOP on an arcade-style game.

## About the Game
You are the red car, trying to save as many blue lost souls spinning on the highway as possible. You can change your speed and shoot holy water out of your car. Holy water can destroy zombie cabs and zombie pedestrians. You can collect objects that increase your health points or available holy water projectiles. Driving over an oil slick causes you to slip, sending you in a random direction. You lose health points by hitting zombies or the highway barriers. If you hit a human pedestrian, you lose a life. You can progress to the next level by saving enough souls.
