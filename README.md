# GhostRacer

CS 32 Project 3 â€” Arcade Car Game

GhostRacer is a project applying OOP on an arcade-style game.

# About the Game
You are the red car, trying to save as many lost souls as possible. These souls are blue characters spinning on the highway. You can change your speed and shoot holy water out of your car. Holy water can destroy zombie cabs and zombie pedestrians. Hitting a human pedestrian causes you to lose a life. You can progress to the next level by saving enough souls.
